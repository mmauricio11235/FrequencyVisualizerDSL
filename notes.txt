 Essentially 3 different areas of music that I'd like the user to be 
 able to have affect. 

 1.) Time of the current song

 2.) Frequency range of the music

 3.) Amplitude of the sound at any given frequency range.  

 For now, my goal is to allow the user to create simple frequency visualizer, which for now I hope will be created to look like the following:



time(0, 100){
	frequency(0, 20){
		amplitude(0, 20){
			object(image())
		}	
	}
	frequency(20, 50){
		amplitude(0,20){
			image()
		}
	}

	frequency(50-70){
		amplitude(0,20){
			image()
		}
		amplitude(20, 50){
			image();
			angle();
			size();
		} 
		amplitude(60,100){
			image('link')
			angle();
			size();
			effect();
		}

	frequency(70-100){
		amplitude(0,50){
			image('link')
		}
	}
}
